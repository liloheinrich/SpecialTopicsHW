HW problems for the Integer Programming & Heuristic Algorithms Units

Specifically, this repository includes:

BAB: Question 3 on your homework. Instructions for getting started can be found here: https://github.com/AdvancedAlgorithms/SpecialTopicsHW/blob/master/BAB/Branch_and_bound_problem.pdf

VRP: **Not a question on your homework!!**. We've kept it here in case one of you feels *particularly* motivated and wants to try it out (not at all a requirement for the homework)! Instructions for getting started can be found here: https://github.com/AdvancedAlgorithms/SpecialTopicsHW/blob/master/VRP/Vehicle_Routing_Problem.pdf.
